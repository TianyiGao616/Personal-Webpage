Hi, I'm Tianyi Gao. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm an undergraduate student at Boston University majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I’m passionate about applied statistics and its real-world impact — especially in areas like biostatistics, computational biology, and machine learning.

I plan to graduate in January 2026 and am preparing to pursue a PhD in a statistics-related field.

Hi, I'm Tianyi Gao — you can call me Amy!



I was born and raised in Wuhan, China, where I completed my A-Level studies in Mathematics, Physics, and Economics at Wuhan Britain-China International School. 

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at Boston University majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I plan to graduate in January 2026 and am currently preparing to pursue a PhD in a statistics-related field.

Beyond academics, I enjoy going to the gym — I typically work out four times a week. I also like exploring new sports such as yoga and tennis. I'm passionate about singing; my favorite singer is Faye Wong, and I’ve been a fan for over ten years. I also love hanging out with friends and trying new foods :)

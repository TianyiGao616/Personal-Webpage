My name is Tianyi Gao, you can also call me Amy!

I was born and raised in [Wuhan, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan), where I completed my high school A-level studies at the [Wuhan Britain-China International School](http://www.whbc2000.com/en/index.aspx).

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at Boston University majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I plan to graduate in January 2026 and am currently preparing to pursue a PhD in a statistics-related field.

Beyond academics, I enjoy going to the gym — I typically work out four times a week. I also like exploring new sports such as yoga and tennis. I'm passionate about singing; my favorite singer is Faye Wong, and I’ve been a fan for over ten years. I also love hanging out with friends and trying new foods :)
